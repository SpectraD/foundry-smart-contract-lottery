## Smart Contract Lottery

This is a lottery project using Solidity and Foundry. The code can be explored directly on this repository.

This project was made possible by the course from Patrick Collins: https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/foundry

**Explore the Code**
- You can explore the code directly on this repository by looking at the Solidity files in the `/contracts` directory.
- You can test the coverage of the project with this command : `forge test coverage` and see unit test : `forge test`

## Foundry Explanation

**Foundry is a blazing fast, portable and modular toolkit for Ethereum application development written in Rust.**

Foundry consists of:

-   **Forge**: Ethereum testing framework (like Truffle, Hardhat and DappTools).
-   **Cast**: Swiss army knife for interacting with EVM smart contracts, sending transactions and getting chain data.
-   **Anvil**: Local Ethereum node, akin to Ganache, Hardhat Network.
-   **Chisel**: Fast, utilitarian, and verbose solidity REPL.
